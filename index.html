				Masks Matter is a student-led non-profit organization dedicated to spreading the belief that everyone, students especially, have the capability to design safe, effective, and innovative masks of their own. This summer, we are hosting a mask designing competition to encourage students to apply their creativity and innovation to helping their community in times of crisis. COVID-19 is not only a threat to our public health, but a threat to our education as well. Our schools cannot fully reopen and we cannot receive a quality education until we flatten the curve. Please join us in our efforts, because every additional mask helps secure a healthier future. 
				Best,
				Masks Matter Team
